For product and [pricing](https://about.khulnasoft.com/pricing/) information, visit
[about.khulnasoft.com](https://about.khulnasoft.com) or [contact
us](https://about.khulnasoft.com/contact/sales) for more information. If you're just starting out,
we recommend running Khulnasoft as a [single Docker
container](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/#quickstart-guide) or using [Docker
Compose](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/admin/install/docker-compose). Migrating to Khulnasoft on
Kubernetes is easy later.

## Is Docker Compose the right deployment type for me?

Please see [our docs](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/admin/install) for comparisons of deployment types and our resource estimator.

## Pure-Docker Khulnasoft cluster deployment reference

What if your organization wants a multi-machine deployment without using Kubernetes?
What if you use a different container management platform, for example?
Anyone using a container management platform other than Kubernetes (Netflix's [Titus](https://netflix.github.io/titus/), Apache's [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/docker-containerizer/), etc.) can use our [Pure-Docker Khulnasoft cluster deployment reference](./pure-docker/README.md) to deploy Khulnasoft.
